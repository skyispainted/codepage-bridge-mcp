## File encoding policy

Use Codepage Bridge for all project file content operations:

- Read with `mcp__codepage-bridge__Read`.
- Search with `mcp__codepage-bridge__Grep`.
- Edit with `mcp__codepage-bridge__Edit`.
- Create or completely rewrite with `mcp__codepage-bridge__Write`.

Do not use built-in Read, Grep, Edit, Write, NotebookEdit, shell commands,
PowerShell commands, or scripts as substitutes for project file content access.
Glob may only be used to discover paths.

Do not manually transcode files or normalize line endings. `.encoding-rules`
is the source of truth.
